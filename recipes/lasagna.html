            <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>2 (24-ounce) jars spaghetti sauce</li>
            <li>12 oven-ready, no-boil lasagna noodles</li>

        <h3><em>Steps</em></h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
            <li>Position a rack in the center of the oven and heat to 375 F. Spray a 9 x 13-inch baking dish with cooking spray. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. When the oil shimmers,
                 add the ground beef and the onion. Cook, stirring occasionally, until brown, about 7 minutes.</li>
            <li>Drain, if necessary. Set aside.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, eggs, 
                1/2 cup of the shredded Asiago cheese, 
                Italian seasoning, garlic powder, and pepper. Set aside</li>
            <li>Place about 3/4 cup of the spaghetti sauce on the 
                bottom of the prepared dish.</li>
            <li>Top the sauce with a single layer of four lasagna noodles (it's OK if they overlap).</li>
            <li>Spread half the ricotta cheese mixture evenly over the noodles.</li>
            <li>Top the ricotta cheese mixture with half of the ground beef.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle the remaining 1 cup of Asiago cheese over the ground beef.</li>
            <li>Top that with 1/3 of the remaining spaghetti sauce</li>
            <li>Then, repeat the layer: four lasagna noodles, the remaining ricotta mixture,
                 the remaining ground beef, the shredded Parmesan cheese, 
                 and 1/3 of the remaining spaghetti sauce.</li>
            <li>Put the final four lasagna noodles in an even layer over the spaghetti sauce.
                 Slather the top with any remaining spaghetti sauce</li>
            <li>Sprinkle the shredded mozzarella cheese over the top.</li>
            <li>Cover with foil and bake until the noodles are cooked through, about 40 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove the foil and bake until the cheese is bubbly and golden, 10 to 15 minutes longer.
                 It's important to let the lasagna rest for at least 15 minutes before serving.
                  It needs to set, otherwise, it'll be a gloopy mess when you cut it.</li>
                  <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
